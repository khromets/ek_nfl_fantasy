# NFL Data Source Analysis

## Test Results Summary

### nfl-data-py Package
- **Status**: ❌ Installation Failed
- **Issue**: Pandas compilation issues on macOS ARM64
- **Error**: C++ compiler errors when building pandas dependency
- **Recommendation**: Try with conda environment or use pre-built wheels

### ESPN API
- **Status**: ✅ Partially Available
- **Accessible Data**:
  - Team information (32 teams)
  - Recent game schedules and scores
  - Basic statistics endpoint
- **Missing Data**:
  - Player rosters (endpoint returned 0 athletes)
  - Historical player statistics
  - Detailed play-by-play data

### Alternative Data Sources to Investigate

#### 1. Pro Football Reference (Scraping)
- **Pros**: Most comprehensive historical stats, fantasy-relevant data
- **Cons**: Requires web scraping, rate limiting concerns
- **Data Available**: 2020-2024 player stats, fantasy points, advanced metrics

#### 2. Sleeper API
- **Pros**: Fantasy-focused, free for personal use
- **Cons**: May lack detailed historical data
- **Focus**: Player rankings, fantasy projections

#### 3. NFL Official API
- **Pros**: Official source, reliable
- **Cons**: May have access restrictions, limited historical data

#### 4. Fantasy Data APIs
- **Pros**: Fantasy-focused statistics
- **Cons**: Often paid services
- **Examples**: FantasyData.com, SportsData.io

## Recommended Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Quick Start with ESPN + Scraping
1. Use ESPN API for:
   - Team data and schedules
   - Current season basic stats
2. Implement Pro Football Reference scraping for:
   - Historical player statistics (2020-2024)
   - Fantasy points and advanced metrics
   - Position-specific stats

### Phase 2: Enhanced Data Collection
1. Research and test additional APIs:
   - Sleeper API for fantasy data
   - NFL.com official endpoints
2. Build robust data pipeline with error handling
3. Implement data validation and cleaning

### Phase 3: Backup Solution
1. Try nfl-data-py in conda environment
2. Consider Docker container with pre-built dependencies
3. Evaluate paid APIs if free sources are insufficient

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Required Python Packages
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml pandas sqlite3
```

### Data Storage Strategy
- SQLite for development and testing
- PostgreSQL for production if data volume is large
- Parquet files for efficient analytics processing

### Web Scraping Considerations
- Implement respectful rate limiting (1-2 seconds between requests)
- Use user-agent headers to identify scraper
- Handle pagination and dynamic loading
- Implement retry logic for failed requests

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement Pro Football Reference scraper prototype
2. **Short-term**: Test data quality and completeness
3. **Medium-term**: Build data validation and transformation pipeline
4. **Long-term**: Evaluate need for additional data sources

## Files Created
- `dev/test_nfl_data.py` - Tests nfl-data-py package and alternatives
- `dev/test_espn_api.py` - Tests ESPN API endpoints
- `dev/nfl_data_source_analysis.md` - This analysis document

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: ESPN API is stable and publicly accessible
- **Medium Risk**: Web scraping may face rate limits or structure changes
- **High Risk**: Relying solely on free APIs may limit data quality/quantity
